# BioGeoSyn 1.1.0

Adds the biogeographic process synthesis: the interpretive layer that turns
raw BioGeoBEARS stochastic mapping into named biogeographic processes, intended
as the analytical centerpiece for reporting and publication.

- Added `biogeographic_process_taxonomy()`, a canonical mapping from
  BioGeoBEARS event codes (`y`, `s`, `v`, `j`, `d`, `e`, `a`) to interpretable
  biogeographic processes (in-situ/sympatric speciation, subset sympatry,
  vicariance, founder-event jump speciation, range expansion, local extinction,
  range switching), grouped into cladogenetic speciation modes and anagenetic
  range changes.
- Added `summarize_biogeographic_processes()`, which aggregates the BSM event
  summary into a per-process table with mean counts and within-group and
  overall proportions, written to `biogeographic_process_summary.csv`.
- Added `plot_biogeographic_process_synthesis()` and a
  `biogeographic_process_synthesis` workflow figure that displays mean event
  counts per process, coloured by process class.
- Surfaced the process synthesis as the headline of the report's stochastic
  mapping section and documented the new table and figure.
- Added a single-most-likely-range view of the ancestral reconstruction
  alongside the probability pies. `plot_node_state_summary(style = "single")`
  draws one solid, area-code-labelled disc per internal node (text colour is
  chosen for contrast against each fill), which stays legible on large trees
  where the pies blur together. The single-clade results tab now shows both
  views and the workflow writes `node_state_summary_*_single` figures.
- Added a `max_range_size_covers_observed_ranges` validation check. BioGeoBEARS
  rejects an entire run when any taxon occupies more areas than
  `max_range_size`, so the check now catches this before any model is fitted and
  names the taxa that exceed the limit.
- Fixed a run where every model failed reporting `comparison is missing required
  columns: delta_aicc, has_j` from the figure code. The raw status table was
  returned as if it were a model comparison, which discarded the error
  BioGeoBEARS had actually reported; the run now stops with that error instead.

# BioGeoSyn 1.0.0

First beta release (beta 1.0): a publishable, feature-complete reproducible
workflow, GUI, and reporting layer for single-clade BioGeoBEARS analyses.

- Added BioGeoBEARS BSM stochastic mapping for completed model results,
  including `bsm_run_status.csv`, `bsm_event_summary.csv`,
  `bsm_replicate_counts.csv`, `bsm_dispersal_routes.csv`, `bsm_events.csv`,
  `bsm_event_times.csv`, raw per-model BSM RDS outputs, report sections, Shiny
  views, and BSM figures.
- Completed the simplified Chinese localization of the Shiny interface,
  translating the advanced config editor, run options, BSM controls, advanced
  constraint fields, all advanced-results and troubleshooting sub-tabs, figure
  dashboard labels, and the initial status message so the guided flow and
  advanced views share one consistent language.
- Fixed a ggplot2 3.5 deprecation warning in the best-model node-state figure by
  replacing the deprecated `label.size` argument with `linewidth`.
- Fixed an R CMD check NOTE by declaring `sd_count` as a known global variable
  used in the BSM event-summary figure.
- Made package metadata publication-ready: set a real maintainer email,
  consolidated authorship into a single `Authors@R` entry, and rewrote
  `inst/CITATION` to use `bibentry()` with an auto-synced package version.
- Achieved a clean `R CMD check --no-manual` with no errors, warnings, or notes.

# BioGeoSyn 0.2.1
