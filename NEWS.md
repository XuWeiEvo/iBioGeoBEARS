  figures for report-level +J interpretation.

  workflow execution, report rendering, and result bundling.

  downloads.
- Added Shiny server-level tests for validation, dry-run workflow execution,
  report rendering, and result bundling.

  directory.
- Added Shiny CSV table previews from the workflow manifest or tables
  directory.
- Added Shiny report path display and an open-report action for rendered
  reports.

  completed models, warnings, report, and bundle availability.
- Grouped Shiny sidebar controls into project, run-option, workflow, and
  report/export sections.
- Added dedicated Shiny result panels for model comparison, `+J` sensitivity,
  and captured model warnings.
- Added dedicated Shiny result panels for node-state summaries and node-state
  `+J` sensitivity comparisons.
- Added a Shiny figure dashboard for standard model-comparison, root-state,
  node-state, and node-sensitivity PNG outputs.
- Added Shiny support for loading existing workflow output directories without
  rerunning the analysis.
- Added a Shiny run-summary result tab for best-model, `+J` caution, warning,
  report, and output-path triage.
- Added Shiny export support for `tables/shiny_run_summary.csv` and a run
  summary download button.
- Added Shiny run-summary status cards while keeping the CSV/table summary as
  the shared data source.
- Added a Shiny key-files table for common result CSVs, reports, and bundles.
- Added Shiny controls to refresh key files and create result bundles only when
  missing.
- Clarified Shiny key-file status wording with next-step hints for missing
  reports, bundles, and result tables.
- Standardized Shiny key-file action feedback with `Report ready:`,
  `Bundle ready:`, and `Key files refreshed:` messages.
- Added compact Shiny summaries for model fit, +J sensitivity, and captured
  warnings before the detailed result tables.
- Expanded the Shiny figure dashboard with preview status, missing reasons,
  and recommended next steps for missing or failed figures.
- Added a Shiny table-status view for key CSV outputs with row and column
  counts, missing reasons, and recommended next steps.
- Added a Shiny About/Citation view for BioGeoBEARS availability, citation
  guidance, license, package version, and workflow log paths.
- Added report-environment checks for source, HTML, and PDF output, including
  Shiny visibility and fallback guidance when Quarto or LaTeX is unavailable.
- Added staged Shiny progress messages for validation, workflow execution,
  output refresh, report rendering, and result bundling.
- Added Shiny failed-model diagnostics in run summaries, warning summaries,
  run-status details, and staged workflow messages.
- Added `bundle_diagnostics()` and Shiny diagnostic-bundle export for lightweight
  troubleshooting archives containing config, status tables, manifests, session
  metadata, and log files.
- Added a first-pass Shiny config editor for common project, input,
  `max_range_size`, and model-selection overrides.
- Added Shiny config-editor fields for advanced BioGeoBEARS constraint files,
  including times, distances, dispersal multipliers, area-allowed, adjacency,
  and area-of-areas files.
- Updated README workflow documentation for command-line runs, Shiny GUI use,
  result triage, key outputs, report rendering, and result bundling.
- Added a `shinytest2` browser smoke script for the Shiny workflow runner.
- Updated GitHub Actions to treat optional `Suggests` packages as optional
  during dry-run CI checks.

# iBiogeobears 0.1.0

Initial alpha release of the single-clade BioGeoBEARS workflow MVP.

## Workflow

- Added YAML-driven project configuration and validation.
- Added `create_example_project()` for a runnable bundled example.
- Added `run_workflow()` to coordinate validation, project output creation,
  BioGeoBEARS execution, standardized tables, figures, logs, and reports.

## BioGeoBEARS integration

- Added `run_models()` support for DEC, DEC+J, DIVALIKE, DIVALIKE+J,
  BAYAREALIKE, and BAYAREALIKE+J.
- Added per-model raw output directories, `.rds` result files, logs, run status
  tables, and warning summaries.
- Added advanced YAML constraint fields for BioGeoBEARS input files.

## Outputs and reporting

- Added standardized model comparison, parameter, ancestral-state, root-state,
  and sensitivity tables.
- Added model comparison and root-state probability figures.
- Added Quarto report rendering with executive summary, model status, warnings,
  fit metrics, +J sensitivity summary, methodological cautions, and citation
  guidance.

## Methodological guardrails

- Added model comparison cautions around +J models.
- Added readable `model_sensitivity.csv` output.
- Kept automatic biological best-model declaration disabled by default.

## Infrastructure
